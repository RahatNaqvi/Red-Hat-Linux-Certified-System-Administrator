It involves resizing the LV and then resizing the file system to make use of the new space. 
Increase the Size of the Volume Group (Optional)
If you do not have enough free space in your volume group, youâ€™ll need to add a new physical volume and extend the volume group.
Add a New Physical Volume:	sudo pvcreate /dev/sdX
Extend the Volume Group:		sudo vgextend <volume_group_name> /dev/sdX
Extend the Logical Volume
Check Free Space in the Volume Group:	sudo vgdisplay <volume_group_name>
Extend the Logical Volume: 
Extend by a specific size:		sudo lvextend -L +<size> <logical_volume_path>
sudo lvextend -L +10G /dev/mapper/vg0-lv0
Extend to use all available space:
sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE <logical_volume_path>
sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/mapper/vg0-lv0
Resize the File System
The file system must be resized to utilize the additional space.
For ext4 File Systems:			sudo resize2fs <logical_volume_path>
For xfs File Systems:			sudo xfs_growfs <mount_point>
Note: xfs_growfs requires the logical volume to be mounted.
Verify the Resize
Check the Logical Volume Size:		sudo lvdisplay <logical_volume_path>
Check the File System Size:			df -h
Example Workflow
Check the Current Volume and File System Size:		df -h
sudo lvdisplay /dev/mapper/vg0-lv0
Extend the Logical Volume:		sudo lvextend -L +5G /dev/mapper/vg0-lv0
Resize the File System:			sudo resize2fs /dev/mapper/vg0-lv0  # For ext4
Verify the Changes:			df -h
