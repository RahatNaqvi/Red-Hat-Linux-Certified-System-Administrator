Preserving system journals ensures that critical system logs are saved for future reference, troubleshooting, and compliance. To preserve system journals in Linux, you need to configure systemd-journald to store logs persistently on disk rather than only in volatile memory. Here are the steps to achieve this:
Create the Journal Directory: Storage for journal logs is located in /var/log/journal/. If this directory does not exist, you need to create it: 
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/journal
Set Correct Permissions: Directory should have correct permissions.
sudo systemd-tmpfiles --create --prefix /var/log/journal
Configure systemd-journald: Edit the journald configuration file to enable persistent logging: 		sudo nano /etc/systemd/journald.conf
Look for the line that starts with Storage= and set it to persistent: 
[Journal]
Storage=persistent
If the Storage= line is commented out, remove the # and update its value.
Restart systemd-journald: After making changes to the configuration, restart the systemd-journald service to apply them: 	sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald
Verify Persistence: After a reboot, check if the logs are being stored persistently: 						journalctl --disk-usage
If logs are preserved after rebooting, the persistent storage is working.
Optional Configurations:
Limit Disk Usage: You can configure limits to control the amount of disk space used by the journal: 
    • SystemMaxUse=: Maximum disk space that journal logs can use.
    • SystemKeepFree=: Amount of disk space to keep free for other uses.
    • SystemMaxFileSize=: Maximum size of individual journal files.
These options can be set in:			/etc/systemd/journald.conf.
Example Configuration:
[Journal]
Storage=persistent
SystemMaxUse=500M
SystemKeepFree=100M
SystemMaxFileSize=50M
By following these steps, system journals will be preserved across reboots.
