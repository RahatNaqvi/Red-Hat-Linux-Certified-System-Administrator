It can be done using command-line tools or network configuration files. 
Using Command-Line Tools: You can use ip or ifconfig to configure IP addresses temporarily (they will reset after a reboot).
IPv4 Configuration
List existing interfaces:				ip addr	or Ip addr show 
Ip addr show eth2 (u can look is up or down)
Assign an IPv4 address:				sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev eth0
Replace 192.168.1.100/24 with your desired IP address and subnet, and eth0 with your network interface.
Bring the interface up:				sudo ip link set dev eth0 up
IPv6 Configuration
Assign an IPv6 address:			sudo ip -6 addr add 2001:db8::1/64 dev eth0
Replace 2001:db8::1/64 with your desired IPv6 address and prefix length.
Bring the interface up:			sudo ip link set dev eth0 up
Just as info: Netw
Configuring IP Addresses Permanently: Edit the network configuration files.
For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems
Edit the network configuration file:			sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
Add or modify the following lines for IPv4:
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.1.100
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.1.1
Add or modify the following lines for IPv6:
iface eth0 inet6 static
address 2001:db8::1
netmask 64
gateway 2001:db8::1
Restart the networking service:		sudo systemctl restart networking
For Red Hat/CentOS-based systems
Edit the network configuration file:	
sudo nano /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
Add or modify the following lines for IPv4:
BOOTPROTO=none
IPADDR=192.168.1.100
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
GATEWAY=192.168.1.1
Add or modify the following lines for IPv6:
IPV6ADDR=2001:db8::1/64
IPV6_DEFAULTGW=2001:db8::1
Restart the networking service:				sudo systemctl restart network
Verification
Check IP addresses:				ip addr
Ping IPv4:							ping 8.8.8.8
Ping IPv6:							ping6 2001:4860:4860::8888
