This is typically done using systemctl, which interacts with systemd to control services. Here's how to manage network services:
Starting a Network Service
sudo systemctl start [service_name]
Example: 		sudo systemctl start sshd
Stopping a Network Service
sudo systemctl stop [service_name]
Example:		sudo systemctl stop sshd
Restarting a Network Service
sudo systemctl restart [service_name]
sudo systemctl restart sshd
Reloading a Network Service
sudo systemctl reload [service_name]
sudo systemctl reload apache2
Checking the Status of a Network Service
systemctl status [service_name]
systemctl status sshd
Enabling and Disabling Services at Boot
sudo systemctl enable [service_name]
sudo systemctl disable [service_name]
Listing All Services
systemctl list-units --type=service
Example: Managing the Network Manager Service
Start Network Manager: 
sudo systemctl start NetworkManager
Stop Network Manager: 
sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager
Check Network Manager Status: 
systemctl status NetworkManager
