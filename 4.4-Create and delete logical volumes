Logical Group uses Physical Volume	-	Physical volume are added to Logical volume
    • Physical Volumes (PVs): These are the underlying storage devices (e.g., hard drives, SSDs, partitions) that LVM uses.
    • Volume Group (VG): A VG is a container that groups together one or more PVs. It's like a storage pool from which logical volumes are created.
    • Logical Volumes (LVs): These are the virtual partitions that you create from the VG. They are the filesystems you actually mount and use.
In essence: PVs are added to a VG, and then LVs are carved out of the VG. The VG acts as an intermediary, abstracting the physical storage and providing flexibility in how storage is allocated
It uses Logical Volume Manager (LVM) involves a few straightforward steps. 
Creating Logical Volumes
Create a Physical Volume (if not already done):	sudo pvcreate /dev/sdX
Create a Volume Group (if not already done): sudo vgcreate <volume_group_name> /dev/sdX
Create a Logical Volume:
sudo lvcreate -L <size> -n <logical_volume_name> <volume_group_name>
sudo lvcreate -L 10G -n my_lv my_vg	
Format the Logical Volume (optional): 
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/<volume_group_name>/<logical_volume_name>
Mount the Logical Volume (optional):	
sudo mkdir /mnt/<mount_point>
sudo mount /dev/<volume_group_name>/<logical_volume_name> /mnt/<mount_point>
Replace <mount_point> with the desired mount point directory.
Deleting Logical Volumes
Unmount the Logical Volume (if mounted):	sudo umount /mnt/<mount_point>
Delete the Logical Volume:
sudo lvremove /dev/<volume_group_name>/<logical_volume_name>
(Optional) Remove the Volume Group: If you no longer need the volume group:
sudo vgremove <volume_group_name>
(Optional) Remove the Physical Volume: If you want to remove the physical volume from LVM management:				sudo pvremove /dev/sdX

Questions-1: Create a LV named LV1 of size 8GB	
Answer: lsblk 
pvcreate /dev/nvme0n3		create many as space was not enough
pvcreate /dev/nvme0n4
pvcreate /dev/nvme0n5			pvs
vgcreate VG1 /dev/nvm0n3 /dev/nvme0n4			vgs
lvcreate -L 8Gb -n LV1 VG1							lvs
nano /et/cfstab
/dev/VG1/LV1 /lv xfs defaults 0 0
Question-2: extend the LV, LV1 by 2GB
mkdir /lv 					mkfs.xfs /dev/VG1/LV1
mount -a 					vgs					lvs 
Ivextend -r -L +2GB dev/VG1/LV1
Size of logical volume VG1/LV1 changed from 8.GB to 10 GIB (2568 extents). Logical volume VG1/LV1 successfully resized. 				Lvs 
Question-3: create a LV LV2 with 10 extent where the size of each extent is 8MB
lvs			pvs				vgdisplay		
lvcreate -n LV2 -l 10 -L 80M VG1	follow the later one
lvs			vgs			vgcreate -s 8M VG1 /dev/nvme0n3	vgdisplay	lvcreate -l 10 -n LV2 /dev/VG1
lvs		80MB
