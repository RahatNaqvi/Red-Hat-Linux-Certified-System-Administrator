A multiuser target refers to a runlevel (or target) where multiple users can log in to the system simultaneously. It is equivalent to the traditional runlevel 3 in SysV init systems, providing a full multiuser environment without a graphical interface. Switch to Multiuser Target mean to change to the multiuser target without restarting. 
Simply logging in the system, and for switching user use su (substitute user)
    • Su username or su - username (the username you want to enter)
    • Su – (for root)
    • sudo – i (for root execution only without switching but gaining the root access)
    • sudo -u username command (Run Command as Another User e.g.) 
sudo -u alice whoami
    • logout or exit
    • for remote login use ssh username@hostname
    • systemctl get-default (You can check the current target using)
    • sudo systemctl isolate multi-user.target (This immediately transitions the system to the multiuser target)
    • Switching Virtual Terminals: In a multiuser system, you can switch between multiple virtual terminals. Access Different TTYs: Use Ctrl + Alt + F1 to Ctrl + Alt + F6 to switch between the available TTYs:
Ctrl + Alt + F1 to F6: Access different terminal sessions (TTYs).
Ctrl + Alt + F7: Often reserved for GUI if a graphical target is active.
Log in on the new TTY with your username and password.
    • Switch back to the original session using the same key combinations
