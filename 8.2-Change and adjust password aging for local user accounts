Force a user to change their password at the next login:	
sudo passwd -e username
Check Current Password Aging Information:			sudo chage -l username
This command shows details like the last password change, password expiration, and account expiration dates.
Modify Password Aging Settingsï¼š	sudo chage -M 90 username
This sets the password to expire after 90 days.
Set the minimum number of days between password changes:
sudo chage -m 7 username
sudo chage -W 7 username	Gives users a warning 7 days before their expiry.
sudo chage -E 2025-12-31 username	#Sets the account to expire on Date.

Additional Security Enhancements
Password Complexity: To enforce password complexity, you can configure PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) by editing the /etc/pam.d/common-password file (Debian/Ubuntu) or /etc/pam.d/system-auth (Red Hat/CentOS) and adding rules for password strength.
Lock Account after Failed Attempts: You can use faillock to lock accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts.
