Using cron for Recurring Tasks
Edit the Crontab File
Open the Crontab Editor:			crontab -e
Add a Cron Job: Use the following format:
* * * * * /path/to/command
        ◦ Fields: 
            ▪ minute (0-59)
            ▪ hour (0-23)
            ▪ day of month (1-31)
            ▪ month (1-12)
            ▪ day of week (0-7) (0 and 7 are both Sunday)
Run a script every day at 3:00 AM:			0 3 * * * /path/to/script.sh
    • if * is put in any of the first 5 fields, it means all the values
    • range of number can be used with a hyphen (-)
    • a comma can be used to include a list of numbers
    • slash (/) can be used to skip a given number of values e.g */4 in hours means every 4 hours
Question_cron: Execute the command /usr/local/bin/backup at exactly 10:00am on Feb, 4th every year
crontab -e
0	10	4	2	*	/usr/local/bin/backup

To permit a user to run cron jobs, list it in /etc/cron.allow file, if file doesnt exist, and /etc/cron.deny exist, make sure the user is not in that file. 
echo "Rahat" | sudo tee -a /etc/cron.allow
