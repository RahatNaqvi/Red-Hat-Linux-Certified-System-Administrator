Modifying the system bootloader in Linux is a sensitive task, as the bootloader is responsible for loading the operating system and allowing you to choose between different boot options (e.g., different Linux kernels, other operating systems, etc.). The process may vary depending on the bootloader you are using, but two of the most common bootloaders for Linux systems are GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader) and systemd-boot.
Modifying GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader)
Editing GRUB Configuration Temporarily: (i.e., without making permanent changes), you can modify the boot parameters at boot time.
Reboot the system and at the GRUB menu, use the arrow keys to select the entry you want to modify (e.g., your default Linux kernel).
Press e to edit the boot parameters. This will bring up an editor where you can modify the boot options.
Locate the line starting with linux (it will contain the kernel and boot options).
Modify the boot parameters as desired. For example, you can add or remove kernel parameters like single for single-user mode or quiet to suppress boot messages.
Press Ctrl + X or F10 to boot with the modified parameters. This change is temporary and will not persist after a reboot.
Editing GRUB Configuration Permanently: If you want to make permanent changes, you’ll need to modify the GRUB configuration files and regenerate the GRUB configuration.
Edit the GRUB configuration file: For most distributions, the primary configuration file is /etc/default/grub. Open it in a text editor with root privileges:
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
Modify the relevant configuration lines:
GRUB_TIMEOUT=5
        ◦ GRUB_DEFAULT: Sets the default boot entry (use the menu entry number or saved to boot the last selected entry). GRUB_DEFAULT=0
        ◦ GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX: Adds custom kernel parameters. 
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="quiet splash"
Save the changes and exit the editor.
Regenerate the GRUB configuration. 
sudo update-grub		For Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu):
sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg		(like Fedora or CentOS):
Reboot to apply the changes:			sudo reboot
Customizing the GRUB Boot Menu (Optional): Such as changing the background image, theme, or colors. This can be done by editing the /etc/grub.d/ directory and using tools like grub-customizer (if available).
Modifying systemd-boot (Used in UEFI Systems)
systemd-boot is a simpler, UEFI-based bootloader used by distributions like Arch Linux, Fedora, and others. 
Editing systemd-boot Entry
Mount the EFI partition (if not already mounted). The EFI partition is typically mounted at /boot/efi or /boot.			sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /boot/efi
Navigate to the bootloader directory:		cd /boot/efi/EFI
Edit the bootloader entry. Systemd-boot entries are usually stored in /boot/efi/EFI/systemd/loader/entries/ or a similar location, and the files typically have .conf extensions.
Open the relevant .conf file for the OS you want to modify:
sudo nano /boot/efi/EFI/systemd/loader/entries/arch.conf
Modify the entry as needed. A typical entry might look like this:
title   Arch Linux
linux   /vmlinuz-linux
initrd  /initramfs-linux.img
options root=PARTUUID=XXXX-XXXX rw
You can modify the options line to add kernel parameters, like quiet or noapic.
Save the file and exit the editor.	Reboot to apply the changes:	sudo reboot
Adding New Entries to systemd-boot: You can create a new .conf file in the /boot/efi/EFI/systemd/loader/entries/ directory, with the same structure as the existing files. Make sure you point to the correct kernel and initrd files.
Kernel Parameters: When editing boot parameters (like quiet, nomodeset, single, etc.), be cautious. Incorrect parameters can prevent the system from booting properly.
