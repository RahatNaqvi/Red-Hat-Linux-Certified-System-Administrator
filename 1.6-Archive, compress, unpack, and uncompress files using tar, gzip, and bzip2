Archiving, compressing, unpacking, and uncompressing files in Linux are common tasks for file management and reducing storage usage. Tools like tar, gzip, and bzip2 help achieve these goals efficiently.
tar stands for "tape archive." It combines multiple files or directories into a single archive file, commonly called a tarball. It does not compress by itself but can be combined with compression tools like gzip or bzip2.
    • tar -cvf archive.tar file1 file2 directory/	(Create a tar Archive)
tar cvf firstTar1.tar mmmm.txt nnn.txt mnmnm.txt
tar cvf /mnt/copy/D1.tar /mnt (is a tar command that creates an archive file named D1.tar in the /mnt/copy/ directory, containing the contents of the /mnt directory. 
-c: Create an archive.		-v: Verbose output (optional, shows progress).
-f: archive.tar: Saves the archive with the name archive.tar.
    • tar -tvf archive.tar (List the contents of the archive without extracting)
tar tf firstTar1.tar 
    • tar -xvf archive.tar
tar xf firstTar1.tar (To extract TAR files)
    • Compress Files with gzip (reduce their size and appends a .gz extension.)
gzip filename	(This replaces filename with filename.gz)
gunzip filename.gz	(This restores filename.gz to its original state.)
tar -czvf archive.tar.gz file1 file2 directory/	(-z: Compress the archive with gzip.)
tar cvfz secTar.tar.gz output.txt output.log
tar -czvf project.tar.gz project/		(Compress the project/ directory into a tar.gz file)
tar -xzvf archive.tar.gz	(Extract a gzip-compressed tar Archive)
    • tar cvfa secTar.tar.gz output.txt output.log (if we use cvfa , then based on tar.gz it will autocompress in gz mode). Multiple tar options are as below
    • bzip2 is another compression tool, often resulting in higher compression ratios than gzip, and appends a .bz2 extension.
    • bzip2 filename	(This replaces filename with filename.bz2.)
    • bunzip2 filename.bz2		(This restores filename.bz2 to its original state.)
    • tar -cjvf archive.tar.bz2 file1 file2 directory/	(-j: Compress the archive with bzip2.)
    • tar -xjvf archive.tar.bz2	(Extract a bzip2-compressed tar Archive)
    • use man tar for help
