It involves configuring the umask value, which determines the default permissions for new files and directories created by a user. Here's how to manage and adjust default file permissions:
Understanding File Permissions
    • Files: Default permissions of 666 (read and write for owner, group, and others).
    • Directories: Default permissions of 777 (read, write, and execute for owner, group, and others).
The umask value subtracts permissions from these defaults.
Checking the Current umask Value:				umask
    • umask is a four-digit octal number.
    • The first digit (usually 0) is reserved and often ignored.
    • The next three digits define permissions for the owner, group, and others.
For example, a umask of 022 means:
    • Owner: No permissions removed (default remains rw- for files).
    • Group: Write permission removed (default becomes r-- for files).
    • Others: Write permission removed (default becomes r-- for files).
Setting a New umask Value：			umask 027
    • Owner: rw-
    • Group: r--
    • Others: ---
To set the umask to any number:		umask 027	(A umask of 027 results in default permissions of 750 rwx rx rx for directories and 639 wr r r for files)
To make the change permanent, add the umask command to your shell configuration file, such as .bashrc or .zshrc.
    • For bash: Add to ~/.bashrc or /etc/bashrc (for system-wide setting).
    • For zsh: Add to ~/.zshrc.
    • For sh: Add to ~/.profile.
Example for ~/.bashrc:					echo 'umask 027' >> ~/.bashrc
Verifying New File Permissions
After changing the umask, create a new file and directory to verify the changes:
touch newfile
mkdir newdir
ls -l newfile newdir
Default umask in System Configuration: To set umask for all users.
sudo nano /etc/profile
Add or modify the line:				umask 027
System will not allow execution for files even umask is there
Understanding umask Values.
Using ACLs for More Granular Control
For more fine-grained control over default permissions, use Access Control Lists (ACLs):
Set Default ACLs:	setfacl -d -m u::rwX,g::r-X,o::--- /path/to/directory
View ACLs:		getfacl /path/to/directory
