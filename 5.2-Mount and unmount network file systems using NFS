Mounting and unmounting Network File Systems (NFS) in Linux allows you to access remote file systems over a network. Here's how to do it:
Installing NFS Utilities: Before mounting NFS shares, ensure that the necessary NFS client utilities are installed:
sudo apt update  sudo apt install nfs-common  
Mounting NFS File Systems
Create a Mount Point:	sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs_share
Mount the NFS Share: 
sudo mount -t nfs <server_ip_or_hostname>:/path/to/nfs/export /mnt/nfs_share
Example:		sudo mount -t nfs 192.168.1.100:/exported_folder /mnt/nfs_share
Verify the Mount: 		df -h
Persistent Mounting: Add an entry in the /etc/fstab file:			
Edit /etc/fstab:			sudo nano /etc/fstab
Add an NFS Entry:
<server_ip_or_hostname>:/path/to/nfs/export  /mnt/nfs_share  nfs  defaults  0  0
Example:	192.168.1.100:/exported_folder  /mnt/nfs_share  nfs  defaults  0  0
Test the Configuration: Mount all file systems defined in /etc/fstab:
sudo mount -a
Unmounting NFS File Systems
Unmount the NFS Share:			sudo umount /mnt/nfs_share
Verify the Unmount: Check if the NFS share is unmounted:		df -h
Additional Options:
Mount Options: You can specify additional mount options for better control, such as:
        ◦ rw: Read/write access.
        ◦ ro: Read-only access.
        ◦ noexec: Do not allow execution of binaries.
        ◦ sync: Writes are synchronized immediately.
Example:
sudo mount -t nfs -o rw,sync 192.168.1.100:/exported_folder /mnt/nfs_share
Check NFS Version: If needed, specify the NFS version to use:
sudo mount -t nfs -o vers=4 192.168.1.100:/exported_folder /mnt/nfs_share
Troubleshooting
Firewall: Ensure that the firewall on both the client and server allows NFS traffic (ports 111 and 2049 by default).
NFS Server Configuration: Ensure the NFS server has the appropriate export configuration in /etc/exports and that the NFS service is running.
    • Permissions: Ensure user has the necessary permissions to access the NFS share.
    • Network Stability: NFS relies on network stability; issues like latency or disconnections can affect performance.
    • Unmount Properly: Always unmount the NFS share properly to avoid potential data corruption or loss.
