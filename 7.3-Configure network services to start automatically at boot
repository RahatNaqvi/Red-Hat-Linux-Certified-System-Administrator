It involves enabling the appropriate services using the system's tool, typically systemd. 
Check the Service Status
Before enabling a service to start at boot, you can check its current status.
sudo systemctl status <service-name>
Replace <service-name> with the name of the service you want to check (e.g., network, NetworkManager, networking, or any specific network-related service).
Enable the Service to Start at Boot: use the systemctl enable command.
For NetworkManager:			sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager
For traditional network service (used in some Red Hat-based distributions):
sudo systemctl enable network
For systemd-networkd (if using systemd for network management):
sudo systemctl enable systemd-networkd
Start the Service Immediately
To start the service immediately without waiting for the next reboot:
sudo systemctl start <service-name>
Verify the Service is Enabled:			sudo systemctl is-enabled <service-name>
Check Logs (Optional): If you encounter issues or want to confirm the service started.  
sudo journalctl -u <service-name>
Example Services
Here are common network-related services you might want to enable:
    • NetworkManager: Manages network connections in many Linux distributions.
    • systemd-networkd: A system service that manages networks.
    • networking: A more traditional network service used in some distributions.
Reboot to Test:			sudo reboot
sudo systemctl status <service-name>
