Using scp (Secure Copy Protocol): It uses SSH to transfer files securely.
scp [options] source_file [user@]destination_host:destination_path
    • Transfer a file to a remote server: 
scp file.txt user@remote_host:/path/to/destination
    • Transfer a file from a remote server to the local system: 
scp user@remote_host:/path/to/file.txt /local/path
-r: Recursively copy directories, and -P [port]: Specify a custom SSH port.
Using rsync: Tool for copying and synchronizing files locally and remotely over SSH.
rsync [options] source [user@]destination_host:destination
    • Synchronize a directory to a remote server: 
    • rsync -avz /local/directory/ user@remote_host:/remote/directory/
Common Options:
    • -a: Archive mode (preserves symbolic links, permissions, etc.).
    • -v: Verbose mode.
    • -z: Compress data during the transfer.
    • -e ssh: Use SSH for data transfer.
Using sftp (SSH File Transfer): File transfer similar to FTP but uses SSH for encryption.
sftp [user@]host
    • Connect to a remote server: 
    • sftp user@remote_host
    • Once connected, use commands like get and put to download and upload files, respectively.
Using sshfs (SSH File System): Allows you to mount a remote filesystem over SSH and interact with it as if it were local.
sshfs [user@]host:/remote/directory /local/mount/point
    • Mount a remote directory: 
    • sshfs user@remote_host:/remote/path /local/mount
Unmounting:
fusermount -u /local/mount
Using scp with Key-based Authentication: To avoid password prompts and increase security, set up SSH key-based authentication: 
        1. Generate a key pair on the local machine: 
        2. ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
        3. Copy the public key to the remote server: 
        4. ssh-copy-id user@remote_host
        5. Now, you can use scp, rsync, or sftp without entering a password.
 Using tar with ssh for Large Transfers: To transfer large directories efficiently.
    • Compress and transfer a directory: 
    • tar czf - /local/directory | ssh user@remote_host "tar xzf - -C /remote/directory"
