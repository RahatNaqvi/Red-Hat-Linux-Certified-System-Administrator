In booting: when you press the power button, the system's BIOS or UEFI firmware initializes hardware components and finds a bootloader.
The bootloader (e.g., GRUB) loads the Linux kernel into memory, and the kernel initializes system components, mounts the root filesystem, and starts the init or systemd process. Then the system launches user-space processes, enabling the user to log in and interact with the system.
