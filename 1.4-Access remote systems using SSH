SSH stands for Secure Socket Shell, or just Secure Shell. It is a network protocol that allows you to log into remote machines and execute commands on them. If you want to connect machine 1 which is at 9th floor but you want to access at machine2 which is at ground. You only need the IP of machine1 and both should be at same network.
The basic syntax to launch SSH is:
[ssh] [user_name@hostname] or [ssh] [user_name@ipaddress]
ssh cloud_user@54.82.999.10	
ssh username@ipaddress e.g. ssh -i ubonto@44.203.80.26
sudo apt update or		sudo apt install openssh-client (To install open ssh)
ssh -V (To check if SSH is installed)
If on workstation-1 you want to connect the workstation-2 then get the IP of workstation-2 lets say it is 192.168.43.22 then on terminal of workstation-1 type 	ssh root @192.168.43.22 and ls	then on workstation-2 	ls	both will be same as will be connected. You can work properly. Then you can create, operate and fully work on remote machine.
            ▪ By default, SSH uses port 22. If the remote system uses a custom port, specify it using the -p option:
            ▪ ssh -p 2222 user@hostname (Here, 2222 is the custom SSH port.)
            ▪ To avoid typing, you can create an SSH config file (usually located at ~/.ssh/config) that defines shorthand for remote connections. Config file is as (myserver.sh):
            ▪ Host myserver
  		HostName 192.168.1.100
  		User user
  		Port 22
  		IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096		save
            ▪ ssh myserver (will connect server)
            ▪ ssh user@hostname 'ls -l /home/user' (List files in /home/user remote system without logging)
            ▪ SSH can forward ports from the remote system to your local machine. This is useful for securely accessing services behind a firewall or NAT.
ssh -L 8080:localhost:80 user@hostname (Forwards port 80 on the remote machine (localhost refers to the remote machine) to port 8080 on your local machine)
    • Copy a file from local to remote:
scp localfile.txt user@hostname:/path/to/remote/directory/ 
    • Copy a file from remote to local:
s	cp user@hostname:/path/to/remotefile.txt /path/to/local/directory/
    • ssh -f user@hostname 'some command' (run an SSH session in the background)
    • ssh -A user@hostname (use your local SSH keys on a remote machine (e.g., to access another system from the remote machine), use the -A option to forward your authentication agent)
Troubleshooting SSH: If you're unable to connect, check whether the firewall on the remote system is blocking port 22 or whatever custom port SSH is using
