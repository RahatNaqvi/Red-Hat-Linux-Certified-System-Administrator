It is often managed using the NTP (Network Time Protocol), and more recently systemd-timesyncd or chrony (depending on your distribution). Time synchronization ensures that your system clock is accurate by synchronizing it with reliable time servers over the network.
There are multiple methods available for configuring time service clients on Linux, and I will describe how to configure them using both systemd-timesyncd (the default service for many distributions) and chrony.
Using systemd-timesyncd (Default for Modern Linux Distributions)
systemd-timesyncd is a lightweight time synchronization service included with systemd. It is commonly enabled by default in many modern distributions 
Enable and Start systemd-timesyncd
Check if systemd-timesyncd is active:	sudo systemctl status systemd-timesyncd
Enable systemd-timesyncd to start at boot:	sudo systemctl enable systemd-timesyncd
Start systemd-timesyncd immediately:		sudo systemctl start systemd-timesyncd
Configure Time Servers
The default configuration for systemd-timesyncd uses public NTP servers, but you can configure your own time servers.
Edit the timesyncd configuration file:	sudo nano /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf
Find the NTP line, and add or modify the servers you want to use. For example:
[Time]
NTP=0.pool.ntp.org 1.pool.ntp.org
You can add more NTP servers or use your internal servers if required.
Save and exit the file. After making changes, restart systemd-timesyncd to apply the configuration:				sudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd
Check Synchronization Status
timedatectl status		Show current time, timezone, and NTP synchronization status
E.g. 
timedatactl			active
timedatectl set-ntp false		
timedatactl			inactive
timedatectl set-ntp true		
timedatactl			active
Using chrony (Advanced Time Synchronization)
Install and Configure chrony
sudo apt update
sudo apt install chrony	or 		sudo apt install chrony -y
Enable chrony to start automatically at boot:	sudo systemctl enable chronyd
Start the service immediately:					sudo systemctl start chronyd
Configure Time Servers in chrony
Edit the configuration file:		sudo nano /etc/chrony/chrony.conf
Find the server lines and modify or add new time servers. For example:
server 0.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
server 1.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
You can add multiple server lines to specify different NTP servers.
Save and exit the configuration file.	
Restart the chronyd service to apply the changes:	sudo systemctl restart chronyd
Verify Synchronization with chrony:		chronyc tracking
You can also use the chronyc sources command to view the servers that your system is synchronized with:							chronyc sources
By configuring the NTP clients (systemd-timesyncd, chrony, or ntpd), you ensure that your system clock is synchronized with reliable time servers, which is essential for accurate timestamps, logs, and network-related tasks.
naqvi@rahat:/etc/apt$ systemctl status chronyd
systemctl stop chronyd
naqvi@rahat:/etc/apt$ systemctl disable chronyd
